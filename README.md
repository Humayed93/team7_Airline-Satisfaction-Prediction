# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction
## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting passenger satisfaction in the aviation industry. The project utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) for data processing, model training, deployment, and evaluation.

## Motivation
This project was developed as a final project for the MSc in Business Analytics program. It aims to showcase the practical application of machine learning and cloud computing in solving real-world problems. By predicting passenger satisfaction, the project addresses a critical need in the aviation industry and demonstrates the potential impact of data-driven decision-making on business performance.

## Key Features
* Data Collection: Collect and preprocess data required for model training.
* Model Building: Build a machine learning model to predict passenger satisfaction.
* AWS Integration: Utilize AWS services for data processing, model training, and deployment.
* Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint(a website with api call) for real-time predictions.
* Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using various metrics and suggest improvements.
