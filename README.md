# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction
## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation and files related to the Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction project. The project aims to predict passenger satisfaction in the aviation industry using machine learning techniques.

## Motivation
This project was developed as a final project for the MSc in Business Analytics program. It aims to showcase the practical application of machine learning and cloud computing in solving real-world problems. By predicting passenger satisfaction, the project addresses a critical need in the aviation industry and demonstrates the potential impact of data-driven decision-making on business performance.

## Key Features
* Data Collection: Collect and preprocess data required for model training.
* Model Building: Build a machine learning model to predict passenger satisfaction.
* AWS Integration: Utilize AWS services for data processing, model training, and deployment.
* Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint(a website with api call) for real-time predictions.
* Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using various metrics and suggest improvements.


## Files
- `Canvas Model/`: Contains files related to the SageMaker no-code model (Canvas model) used for the project.
- `Data/`: Includes data files uploaded to the repository.
- `index.html`: HTML file serving as the user interface (UI) for the deployed endpoint.
- `team7_Airline-Satisfaction-Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository contents.

## Usage
1. The `team7_Airline-Satisfaction-Prediction.ipynb` notebook contains the main code for the project. Open this notebook in a Jupyter environment to view and run the code.
2. The `index.html` file serves as the user interface (UI) for the deployed endpoint. This HTML file can be accessed to interact with the deployed model and receive predictions on passenger satisfaction.
